# Week-2-Assignment
The first sheet in the clean data spread sheet contains the employee data set which I have cleaned. I applied the followings step to the first sheet:
I filtered out the spaces and delect the space. i went to find select>blank. Than I delected the blank rows.
Secondly I customise the salary to dollar
Then use the proper and trim function to employee names and then later remove the format from the cell copy and pasting values only. this to enable me find and replace values easily.
next i added table format.
finally I change corrected the date format.
On the second sheet I imported text file into the excel using the delimiter dialogue box and clicked finished.
I used the find function in column B to  find semi-colon to in column which contains my texts.
Then I created a column C and use the LEN function to determine the total length of text character,
I create a new column and use left function to call out the names only from other text based on column B then subtcracted 1 to remove the semi-colon. I also imposed the proper function and applied to other cells, 
I used the right function for a new column to callout the remaining text. 
I cuurency format for the salary
On the third sheet, I impported the text using the delimiter. I set the delimiter as semi-colon and continued to finish. It automatically split the data into each column. I also used flash fill (cont'l E) to fil remaining names
